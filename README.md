# Treap-Implementation


Treap is a data structure that combines the features of Tree and Heap data structure. Each node in the treap has a search key that complies with the feature of the binary search tree where the key value of a node must be larger than that of its left child and smaller than that of its right child. Also, each node possesses a random priority in the treap that complies with the property of a min-heap. Treap supports operations like insertion, deletion, search, joining and splitting in 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛) expected time. In this report, some experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of this data structure in insertion, deletion and search operations compared to the dynamic array by performing several same sequences of operations. 

4 Experiments:

(1) Time vs. Number of Insertions 

(2) Time vs. Deletion Percentage 

(3) Time vs. Search Percentage 

(4) Time vs. Length of Mixed Operation Sequence
